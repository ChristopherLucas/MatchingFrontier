Author: Gary King, Christopher Lucas, and Richard Nielsen
Maintainer: Christopher Lucas <clucas@fas.harvard.edu>
Description: MatchingFrontier returns the subset of the data with the minimum imbalance for 
	     every possible subset size (N - 1, N - 2, ...), down to the data set with the 
	     minimum possible imbalance. The package also includes tools for the estimation
	     of causal effects for each subset size, as well as functions for visualization
