\Abstract{ \pkg{MatchingFrontier} implements the methods described in
  King, Lucas, and Nielsen (n.d.) for optimizing both balance and 
  sample size. \pkg{MatchingFrontier} supports the computation
  of frontiers for both continuous and discrete metrics, and
  also provides functions for visualizing the frontier.}
