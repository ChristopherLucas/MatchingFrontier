Title: Computation of the Balance - Sample Size Frontier in Matching Methods for Causal Inference 
Author: Gary King, Christopher Lucas, and Richard Nielsen
Maintainer: Christopher Lucas <clucas@fas.harvard.edu>
Description: Returns the subset of the data with the minimum imbalance for 
	     every possible subset size (N - 1, N - 2, ...), down to the data set with the 
	     minimum possible imbalance. Also includes tools for the estimation
	     of causal effects for each subset size, functions for visualization
	     and data export, and functions for calculating
	     model dependence as proposed by Athey and Imbens.
